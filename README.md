🌟 Welcome to my collection of frontend mini-projects!  

💜 Each project was built to practice and improve my web development skills, focusing on core concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

💜 These projects cover a wide range of topics, from simple DOM manipulation to interactive web components and small tools.


🔍 How to Run
Each project is self-contained.
