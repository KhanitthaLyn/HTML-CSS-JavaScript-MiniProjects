🌟 Welcome to my collection of frontend mini-projects!  

💜 Each project was built to practice and improve my web development skills, focusing on core concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

💜 These projects cover a wide range of topics, from simple DOM manipulation to interactive web components and small tools.

📚 Why I Built?

This project collection was part of my learning journey to improve my programming skills.
I aimed to practice core web concepts and strengthen my coding abilities for future backend and full stack projects.

🌟 Next Steps
I am now focusing on:
Backend development with Java + Spring Boot
REST API integration
Full Stack projects

🔍 How to Run
Each project is self-contained.  
Just clone the repository and open the HTML file in your browser!
